# Bananagrama

I like giving people gifts for birthdays, but I also like building useless
things. To kill both these proverbial birds with one proverbial stone, I make
useless sites as gifts. This site (eventually) will enable people to make AIs
of their own devices to play out a slightly modified version of Bananagrams
for cash, prizes, and honor.

## The Rules

// TODO(bsprague): Add the rules and stuff, like 144,000 tiles and whatnot
